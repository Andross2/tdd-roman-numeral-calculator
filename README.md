A TDD guide using Roman numerals - with a twist


This was originally written to be the first section of a book on TDD for web apps.  I abandoned it when I decided it would be better to just dive in with web programming.  Still, if anyone comes across it here and finds it useful, or wants to fork it, feel free :)

If you get to the end of chapter 3, you should be able to finish off on your own to have a pretty neat Roman Numeral calculator...
